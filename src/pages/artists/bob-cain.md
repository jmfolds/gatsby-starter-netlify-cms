Bob has been an artist from child hood starting with drawings of comic book characters. He took all of the Art Classes he could in his public school days. In his teenage years the father of his friend told him he made a living by drafting and designing airplanes. Bob thought now thatâ€™s sounds like it might be an interesting job because it involved drawing and he never thought he could make it as an artist. Through the years he kept developing his artistic ideas while working as a Structural Designer of aircraft. He attended several classes through the years studying drawing, painting and finally found his nitch working with his hands in sculpting stone, clay and since retirement wood carving. His education continues daily.
