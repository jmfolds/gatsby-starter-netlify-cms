description: >
  Bob has been an artist from child hood starting with drawings of comic book
  characters. He took all of the Art Classes he could in his public school days.
  In his teenage years the father of his friend told him he made a living by
  drafting and designing airplanes. Bob thought now thatâ€™s sounds like it might
  be an interesting job because it involved drawing and he never thought he
  could make it as an artist. Through the years he kept developing his artistic
  ideas while working as a Structural Designer of aircraft. He attended several
  classes through the years studying drawing, painting and finally found his
  nitch working with his hands in sculpting stone, clay and since retirement
  wood carving. His education continues daily.
