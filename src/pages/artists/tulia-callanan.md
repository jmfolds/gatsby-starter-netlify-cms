  Although primarily self-taught, I have spent many hours of study with
  well-known artists and continually strive to develop my own talent and skill
  through workshops and studies.


  As an active member of the Wichita Art Community, my work has received awards, both locally and nationally, and many of my pieces are in private collections.


  Painting and sculpting are both creative and rewarding. My personal challenge is to produce a painting or sculpture that not only conveys my own feelings on the subject, but dares the observer to share these feelings or find his own!


  I am also a member of an active cooperative gallery dedicated to promoting the work of local artisans.
