  For 28 years I taught art. Now retired, I study and do art. Sculpture is my soul, my sustinance, my reason to exist. I sculpt the human being, the human emotion, the struggle and the pain. My work is often sad, even heart rending, as is life. In varied materials, often in mixed media, I portray mankind's journey through life and death.
