  Sherry is a native Kansan. She has been sculpting for 19 years. She began
  sculpting after the death of her only child, son Justin 13. She turned to art
  as a form of therapy. It has truly been a blessing. Art has helped her heart
  cope with the loss. Sherry has had many wonderful things happen and has made
  some lasting friends through her art. Sherry studied with accomplished local
  artist Nancy Tapp. She has taken figurative sculpture from Lincoln Fox,
  portrait/bas relief from Eugene Daub, and recently acquired her 80 hour
  certificate in Forensic Art from OU. She is planning further study of forensic
  art in the future with plans of working as a forensic artist. She is a member
  of the Wichita Sculpture Guild. She has exhibited at Century II, Bank IV, Old
  Town, El Dorado Art Gallery, Halstead Fine Arts Festival, Stein Eck Gallery,
  Hutchinson Art Gallery, Ducks Unlimited, Carriage Gallery in Newton, Ks, City
  Arts in Wichita, Center for the Arts, also in Wichita and the Ivory Trading
  Post Gallery in Ouray, Colorado. She currently has her bronze eagle on display
  at the Frank Howell Gallery in Sante Fe, NM. Sherry loves to sculpt children,
  dogs, animals, Indians, and portraits of all kinds of people. Art adds so much
  beauty to the world. Art heals the soul and renews the spirit. All things seem
  possible, for we are all kindred spirits.
