  Art has been a large part of my life for almost as long as I can remember. I started drawing shortly after I first picked up a pencil. Through the years my desire to create has been satisfied through drawing, painting, wildlife photography, and sculpture. I've taken my camera to a great many lonely places to escape the crowds and take in the beauty of the natural world and those who inhabit it. These are the subjects of my art. It is my hope that my art will help others appreciate the need to preserve these animals through the preservation of the habitat necessary to sustain them. All I require of a piece of art is that it grab the eye, evoke an emotion, define the innate qualities of the subject, or capture a moment in time. It doesn't matter to me if the work is realism, stylized, representational, or even abstract. For my own sculptures I am experimenting with different styles, checking out the possibilities, looking to see how all of these things affect the viewers perception of the subject.
