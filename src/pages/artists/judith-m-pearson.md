  Canadian born Judith Pearson currently resides in Wichita, KS. She has studied under many sculptors: the accomplished Wichita sculptor Nancy Tapp, figurative sculptor Lincoln Fox and Eugene Daub for portraiture and bas relief. Most recently Judith completed a course in 3-dimensional sculpture with Barry Badgett of Wichita State University. This course of study included the mediums of clay, wood, aluminum and steel. Ms. Pearson is an active member of: Wichita Women Artists, Artist Guild of Wichita and Wichita Sculptors Guild. Ms. Pearson has developed a masterful command of both portrait and figurative work. Critiques of her sculptures have stated that her portrait work makes her depiction of their loved ones "live" in a way that very few sculptors have achieved. Her uncanny treatment of 'eyes and mood' in her portrait pieces have fascinated and delighted owners of her commissioned pieces. Ms. Pearson pursues a great passion for all good art, and feels that her gifts of being able to contribute to that world, is the most rewarding and exhilarating aspect of her life.
