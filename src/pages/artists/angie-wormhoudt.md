  Art has been a large part of my life for over 50 years, from oil painting, wheat weaving, Stainglass, glass etching, quilting and sculpting. My passion for sculpture started when I met Babs Mellor, the local teacher in Wichita Kansas. I started taking her class in 2003 every semester and I am still there. I enjoy working primarily in water-based Clay. I love doing work that is very meaningful to me and traditional. I can really lose myself when I am sculpting. I have had the pleasure to study under a number of notable sculptors,including Bruno Lucchesi, Vincent Aniano, Lincoln Fox, Walt Horton and Edward Hlavka. I enjoy sculpting with Babs on life-size bronze, Vietnamese American Community Memorial and Mary Elizabeth Lease. I have several tabletop pieces for sale, Bronze and Terra-Cotta. I love to Sculpt figurative, adults, children, Indians, animals and any special subject. I am a perfectionist and it definitely shows in my work.
