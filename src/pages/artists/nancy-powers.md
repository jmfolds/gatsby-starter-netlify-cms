description: "


  Nancy Powers is a Kansas painter/sculptor born in Seattle, Washington raised
  on Mercer Island. She began her creative journey early in life, drawing
  pictures, painting and making images of the animals and birds and the
  landscape on her parents’ farm…yes, there was a time when Mercer Island had
  farms. She spent much of her time playing with the animals and making tree
  houses and camps in the woods so her art often incorporates animals, birds,
  insects, reptiles, amphibians and natural components, wood, stone and metal.
  Nancy exhibited three sculptures and one watercolor in the 2013 Wichita
  Sculpture Guild Show at the Mid\x02America Fine Arts Center, Wichita Kansas.
  In 2014 she participated in the on campus show at the Cadman Gallery Ten Cubed
  show exhibiting one bronze called Cherub. In 2015, she participated in the
  creation of the Peace Pole at Shocker Hall along with the WSU Sculpture Guild
  who was commissioned to make a Peace Pole, a prayer for peace, as part of a
  global peace and art movement. The design is of a globe with three DNA strands
  weaving together to symbolize a shared humanity among nations. In 2015, she
  donated a limestone carving, Fingerbowl and won best sculpture bowl, and in
  2016 donated limestone carving, Snakebowl to the Wichita State Ceramics
  Department Empty Bowls fund-raiser. In 2016, she participated in the Wichita
  State University Trailer Show, exhibiting one bronze called Another Bug, a
  combination of metal and semi-precious stone ammolite. A 2016 carved limestone
  piece, Stone Shovel, was exhibited at Shocker Hall in the atrium."
