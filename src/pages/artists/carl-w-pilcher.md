name: Carl W. Pilcher
location: Valley Center, Kansas
acceptsCommissions: Yes
media: Wood, Clay, Antlers, and Bronze
specialty: Realistic humans and animals, relief
contact: Retired computer analyst from Boeing July 1999. Throughout most of my
  working life I rode the wave of computers into industry and into the home
  while working for IBM (15 years) and Boeing (21 years). I was challenged with
  learning something new every day as computers advanced at an extremely
  accelerated pace.. My artistic interests were left on the back burner,so I
  have not been a lifelong sculptor or artist and I really didn't care for art
  history until I met Babs Mellor. I Began woodcarving classes with Norma Nicks
  January of 1992. I have taken sculpturing and woodcarving classes with over 25
  different instructors since then. I enjoy woodcarving the most, and clay
  sculpture second. I have branched out into antler carving and bronze
  sculpture. I am continuing to learn. My favorite sculpturing subjects are
  realistic human, animals and relief sculpturing. However, I will try most
  anything. In the beginning I carved mostly designs by other artists, but soon
  found that designing and creating my own sculptures is where the real artistic
  creativity is to be found.
