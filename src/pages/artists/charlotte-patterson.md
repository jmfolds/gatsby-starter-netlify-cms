  Charlotte’s traditional sculpture discipline has been shaped by Babs Mellor, John McCluggage, Edward Hlavaka, Eugene Daub and many students at the Wichita Center for the Arts. She is inspired by and excels at many different genres in art although she admits she is particularly drawn to Renaissance and Impressionism periods. Commissions are welcome and encouraged! Charlotte’s next goal is to be commissioned to create a destination art sculpture; art that would draw a viewer off the beaten path to enjoy. Charlotte Patterson is a native Kansan currently residing in Wichita, with her husband, where they are raising two sons. Charlotte credits her Junior High School art teacher, Jack Boge, for encouraging her artistic talents and setting her on the road to explore all artistic mediums. Charlotte is a multi-faceted artist and enjoys exploring arts outside of traditional sculpture including watercolor, acrylic, fused glass, writing and more….she even owns and operates a small business in Wichita that offers face painting, balloon sculptures and décor for events and parties.
