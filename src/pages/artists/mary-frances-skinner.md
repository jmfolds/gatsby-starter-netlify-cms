  Mary Frances Skinner has a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from the University of
  Iowa. After working in the field of Graphic Design and raising five children,
  she revisited the clay that she once loved. Moving from pottery, to vessels
  with portraits on them, to exclusively sculpting people (and angels), she is
  learning more about art, herself and humanity every day. “Often with more
  groaning than creating, I strive to move a vision from my heart into the clay.
  The clay parallels life itself, at times difficult to bear, at other times,
  pliable and willing. I desire to connect the every day with the mystery of the
  eternal. Perhaps it’s making the invisible visible, or finding truth in
  simplicity. As a Catholic artist, my instinct is to echo creation,
  incarnation, love, and God. In this way, my work becomes a prayer.”
