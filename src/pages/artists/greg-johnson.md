  Greg Johnson brings forth his creations from Wichita, Kansas. Untainted by formal art education, his works stand as unique as they are diverse. His media are the materials, tools, and techniques of his 30-year career in automotive collision repair and restoration. In 1996, Greg re-directed his successful 20-year old body repair business and released his employees. Going solo cut both overhead and distractions as well as income; it created time for artistic concentration. "Creating and repairing are parallel with very different outcomes. To repair is problem solving to duplicate the original. To create is problem solving toward an unknown and dynamic end." Greg still spends too much of his energy paying the bills with collision repair, but hopes and prays to convert 100% of his labor to sculpture, as recognition of and demand for his work grows
