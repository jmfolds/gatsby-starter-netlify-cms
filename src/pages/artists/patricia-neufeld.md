  Art is a passion for me and an inner drive that must be fulfilled. Art is many things to many people. It may ignite a memory, give hope to a dream or simply provide visual pleasure. For me, time spent creating is a time to think—to realize new agendas and revisit the past. Through sculpting, I attempt to capture a moment of human expression. This process reassures me that life is indeed good! Whether making representational sculpture or decorative hand-built ceramics, I enjoy the materials and the process of bringing a piece of art to life —using design and texture to produce an object that may rekindle an awareness, affirm an understanding or clearly make the world a more pleasant place in which to live!
