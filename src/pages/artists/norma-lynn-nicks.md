  Expressing myself with art has been my life-long passion. Many mediums attract me, but my joy is in sculpting. I have completed sculptures in clay, bronze, and woodcarvings. I have also worked with paints and pastels and enjoy experimenting with new mediums. Several of my pieces are inspired by my rural upbringing. I wish to leave behind me a love of art, in people and works. There is so much to say and so little time to express it
