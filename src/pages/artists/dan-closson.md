description: ln 1958 at age 11, I watched with amazement the construction of a
  concrete grain elevator. Concrete was continuously poured into a cylindrical
  slip-form that raised 10 inches an hour until reaching 126 feet. I recall
  being impressed how earthen materials were shaped into something so
  functional, even beautiful. Fast forward five decades to 2014 and recently
  retired, I was encouraged by my wife to hear Babs Mellor speak about
  sculpting. lntrigued with the prospect of shaping things in clay, I enrolled
  as a beginner in Babs' sculpting class at The Wichita Center for the Arts. I
  became immersed in learning about clays, sculpting technique and history;
  participating in art-related field trips and developing friendships with those
  of like interests. I find that starting with an idea, a set of photographs, a
  painting some experience or emotion, combined with the geometry of the
  subject, yields my best interpretations. The process of moving from
  inspiration and research, to a beginning shape and refinement, then the
  finish, is a rewarding journey. The act of creation provides enormous
  satisfaction, as eventually each work reveals itself - perhaps not always
  exactly what I originally intended - but sometimes even more interesting.
